# Fraud-Detection-Model-For-Job-Postings

This repository contains the code and documentation for predicting fraudulent job postings using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify job postings as either legitimate or fraudulent based on various features.

## Process Overview

### 1. Business Understanding
Understanding the project goals and domain concepts related to fraudulent job postings is crucial. Fake recruiters often post job listings with the intention of deceiving job seekers and extracting money from them. This creates an unsecured environment and wastes professionals' time. Therefore, it is essential to detect real and fraudulent job postings to ensure a safe and efficient job search process. In this project, a machine learning approach is applied to recognize fake job postings.

### 2. Data Understanding
The dataset used in this project is retrieved from the data collected by The University of the Aegean | Laboratory of Information & Communication Systems Security. The Fraudulent Job Posting Prediction dataset contains job descriptions, with approximately 800 out of 18,000 job descriptions identified as fake. Understanding the variables in the dataset and assessing data quality are essential steps in the data understanding phase.

### 3. Data Preparation
Data preparation involves preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for training machine learning models.

### 4. Modeling
The modeling phase focuses on selecting, tuning, and evaluating machine learning models to predict fraudulent job postings. The project goal is to make predictions about fraudulent job advertisements and detect whether a job advertisement is real or fake. Finding the best attributes for descriptive and predictive models is essential in this phase.

### 5. Deployment
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for real-time classification of job postings. Users can input job description features, and the model will predict whether the job posting is fraudulent or legitimate.

## Future Work

One potential future enhancement is creating an application where users can upload job descriptions and receive a classification of whether the job posting is fraudulent, along with a probability score. Additionally, further improvements can be made by exploring feature selection techniques and developing an app for users to classify job descriptions using the machine learning model.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and contribute to further improving the fraudulent job posting prediction model.
